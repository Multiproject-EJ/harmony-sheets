# LovableSheet audit — 2025-11-01

## Navigation anchors
- Primary navigation includes links to product categories, bundles, community, account, admin pages, and the LovableSheet page itself.
- Module quick navigation within the LovableSheet code library uses descriptive anchors targeting each module section (e.g., “Board library controls”, “Brain board workspace”).

## Responsive layout preview
- Desktop and mobile breakpoints retain card grid structure for the module library and control columns.
- Navigation collapses behind the toggle button on narrow viewports as expected.

## Accessibility notes
- Headings follow a consistent hierarchy with `<h1>` for the workflow introduction, followed by `<h2>` for major sections and `<h3>`/`<h4>` for subcontent inside modules.
- Link text is descriptive throughout; social icon links include `aria-label` attributes for clarity.

## Linting/formatting
- No project-level lint or formatting commands are defined in the repository, so no automated checks were executed.
